      h3 What we need from you
      p Please keep in mind our ChefIt Chef will be cooking in your kitchen, which is required to be fully functional and equipped with the following:
      - const needs = ['Pots and pans', 'Baking dishes', 'Mixing bowls', 'Cutting board', 'Dinnerware (plates, cutlery, glassware, napkins)']
      //- ul
      //-   each need in needs
      //-     li= need

    //- #timing
    //-   p On the day of your dinner, we will send you a notification via e-mail to let you know that the Chef is on their way. The Chef is scheduled to arrive 1.5 to 2 hours prior to the main course being served depending on which package you select.
